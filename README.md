# BadUSB files for FlipperZero and RubberDucky
A collection of BadUSB scripts for IT technicians. Their purpose is to help you with your daily and repetitive tasks, saving you valuable time.

## First solution (recommended, I use that one)
Buy FlipperZero : https://flipperzero.one/ (The most practical.)  
Original & Official software : https://flipperzero.one/downloads  
FlipperZero tested custom firmware : https://momentum-fw.dev/ (Original firmware is OK)  
Keyboard configuration : French AZERTY standard

## Second solution
But USB Rubber Ducky : https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky (The least expensive.)  
Payloads studio : https://payloadstudio.hak5.org/community/

These scripts have been tested in the recommended environment, which is clearly specified. There is no reason they should not function properly. In the unlikely event of an issue, there is no reason they would damage your computer or any other equipment.
